    <h2>Our Story and Philosophy</h2>
    <p>IVLU was born from the vision of Dr. Ivon and Dr. Luisa, who after years of experience in prestigious international clinics, decided to create a space in 2018 that combines the most advanced technology with a deeply human and personalized approach to aesthetic medicine and hair restoration.</p>
    <p>Our philosophy is built on three pillars: medical excellence, natural results, and exceptional experience. We believe in enhancing each person's genuine beauty, not transforming it. Every treatment we perform aims to enhance the natural harmony of the face and body, respecting the unique characteristics that define each patient.</p>
